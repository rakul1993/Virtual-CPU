# Virtual-CPU

For the CENG 356 final project I have created a C program to perform registry level simulation of a CPU based on the ARM Cortex M0+ architecture. The CPU’s memory size is 16Kbytes and uses 32-bit registers. The CPU currently fetches 32-bits of instructions (2x 16-bit instructions) and executes the instructions accordingly. It also has other features such as load file, memory dump, modify memory and more, we provided more detail of functionalities in “Final Program State” section. For most reliable CPU use, we would recommend creating the instruction file using Hex Editor.
